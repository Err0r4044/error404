<p>Once in your life you will understand the meaning of everything, why are you writing this right now, you feel like this is the end, your last moment, you want people to remember you, you don't want to be forgotten, 
maybe you should find a way to become a vampire? And why not after all, it's 2023, nothing should stop anyone, you want to create your own group? go ahead. You want to leave your town? go ahead. Who cares? we all die 
in the end, do what you like, and what you want, stay up all night and sleep during the day if you like it, idk, it won't affect anyone's life but your own, but it's your own, so nobody cares. I don't understand why 
we have so much social pressure, why do we have to identify with something, have our place in society, I don't want to, I want to get a van and see the world, not get a job and work from 8am to 5pm, it's ridiculous, 
but that's what they want from you, and you're all falling for their lie, they're manipulating you, and no one sees it, no one fucking sees it, we're all falling for it, now we even have to go to a school to do art? 
and we have to pay for it? fuck that shit, go learn by yourself, it's better, in school they only teach you how to be a good person in society, not how to be yourself, they're toxic, if you're different they'll 
judge you </p>
